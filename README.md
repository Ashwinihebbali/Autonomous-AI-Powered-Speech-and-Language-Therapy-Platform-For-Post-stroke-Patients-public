<br/>

**A fully offline, AI-powered web application that guides post-stroke Kannada-speaking patients through structured speech rehabilitation exercises — recording their voice, evaluating pronunciation with a custom fine-tuned model, and tracking clinical progress over time.**

<br/>

> Building in collaboration with the **All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH), Mysuru**

## Overview

Kannada Speech Aid is purpose-built for post-stroke patients recovering their ability to speak Kannada. The application walks patients through a structured library of vowels, consonants, words, and sentences — recording their voice, processing it locally with a fine-tuned Whisper model, and giving immediate pronunciation scores and Kannada-language feedback.

Therapists get a separate clinical dashboard to monitor all their patients' sessions, attempt histories, score trends, and add clinical notes — entirely offline, with no patient data leaving the device.

**What makes this different from existing tools:**
- Every existing speech therapy app is English-only
- Every AI speech tool requires internet and sends audio to external servers
- This is the first AI-assisted Kannada speech therapy system — offline, private, and clinically structured

---

## Features

### For Patients
- 🎤 **Voice Recording** — Browser-native microphone capture via Web MediaRecorder API
- 🤖 **Offline AI Scoring** — Each attempt is transcribed and scored 0–100 by a locally running fine-tuned Whisper model — no internet required
- 💬 **Kannada Feedback** — Immediate results in Kannada script (ಅತ್ಯುತ್ತಮ! / ಮತ್ತೆ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಿಸಿ)
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** — Weekly score trend charts and per-category accuracy breakdowns
- 🌐 **Bilingual UI** — Full English ↔ Kannada interface toggle on every page
- ♿ **Clinical Typography** — Large Kannada script display optimised for elderly post-stroke patients

### For Therapists
- 👥 **Patient Roster** — All patients with session count, last session date, average accuracy, and trend badge (Improving / Declining / Stable)
- 📈 **Session History** — Full attempt history per patient, sorted newest first, with per-session accuracy
- 📝 **Clinical Notes** — Editable therapist notes saved per patient for longitudinal observations
- ➕ **Patient Registration** — Register new patients directly from the dashboard

### System-Wide
- 🔒 **Role-Based Auth** — Patient and Therapist roles with protected routes and backend credential validation
- 🛡️ **Full Type Safety** — End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation on every API endpoint
- ⚡ **OpenAPI-First Architecture** — Spec-driven codegen keeps frontend and backend in sync
- 🌍 **Localised UI** — Complete Kannada and English translations throughout

| Words | ನೀರು, ಮನೆ, ಅಮ್ಮ, ಅಪ್ಪ ... | 15 |
| Sentences | Common therapeutic phrases | 7 |

## How It Works

```
Patient speaks into microphone
        │
        ▼
MediaRecorder captures audio (browser)
        │
        ▼
Audio → base64 → POST /api/speech/score (Express)
        │
        ▼
Express → temp .wav file → POST /score (FastAPI, port 8000)
        │
        ▼
Silence check (RMS energy) → if silent, return 0% immediately
        │
        ▼
faster-whisper (fine-tuned Whisper-small, INT8, local CPU)
→ Kannada transcription
        │
        ▼
Multi-method scoring (maximum of four algorithms):
  ├─ Levenshtein character edit distance
  ├─ Longest Common Subsequence ratio
  ├─ Character overlap percentage
  └─ Phoneme map matching (single vowels/consonants)
        │
        ▼
Score (0–100%) + feedback message → saved to PostgreSQL
        │
        ▼
Result displayed to patient:
  🟢 ≥ 80%  →  ಅತ್ಯುತ್ತಮ! (Excellent!)
  🟡 50–79% →  ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದೆ (Good effort)
  🔴 < 50%  →  ಮತ್ತೆ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಿಸಿ (Try again slowly)
```

## Architecture

Three servers run simultaneously on localhost:

```
Browser (localhost:5173)
        ↓ HTTP
Express API (localhost:3000)  ←→  PostgreSQL (localhost:5432)
        ↓ HTTP
Python AI Server (localhost:8000)
        └── faster-whisper (INT8 quantized, offline)
```

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS | Patient + therapist UI |
| Routing | Wouter | Client-side navigation |
| State | TanStack React Query | Server state + caching |
| Animation | Framer Motion | Smooth transitions |
| Charts | Recharts | Progress visualisation |
| API Server | Node.js, Express 5, TypeScript | REST API + session management |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM | Type-safe PostgreSQL queries |
| AI Server | Python 3.12, FastAPI, Uvicorn | Speech inference endpoint |
| Speech Model | faster-whisper (CTranslate2) | Offline Kannada ASR |
| Audio DSP | librosa, numpy, soundfile | Audio preprocessing |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces | Shared types across packages |

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.12+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- PostgreSQL 14+ running as a local service
- The fine-tuned model files (see below)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwinihebbali/Major-Project.git
cd "Major Project/Kannada-Speech-Aid"
```

### 2. Install Node.js dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example files and add your PostgreSQL password:

```bash
cp artifacts/api-server/.env.example artifacts/api-server/.env
cp lib/db/.env.example lib/db/.env
cp scripts/.env.example scripts/.env
```

Each `.env` file needs one line:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/kannada_speech_therapy
```

### 4. Create the database

In psql or pgAdmin:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE kannada_speech_therapy;
```

Push the schema:
```bash
cd lib/db
pnpm db:push
```

### 5. Seed the database

```bash
cd scripts
pnpm seed
```

Creates 46 exercises and demo accounts for testing.

### 6. Set up the Python environment

```bash
cd .agents
python -m venv venv

# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 7. Download the AI model

Place these files at `.agents/stt/models/whisper-kannada-ct2/`:

```
whisper-kannada-ct2/
├── model.bin          ← download separately (236 MB)
├── config.json        ← included in repo
└── vocabulary.json    ← included in repo
```

> Hosting link (Hugging Face Hub) — to be added in Phase 2 release.
